# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard was created as a resource for people to view the weather conditions of specific cities. Users can search for a city and then see both the curren weather for that city as well as the next 5 day forecast. Whenever a city is searched it will get added to a list of searched cities underneath the search input so that users can click and retrieve the weather data for that city. This web page uses HTML and CSS to appear neat and presentable to users. The website also uses Javascript to give the user a sastisfying interactive experience.
